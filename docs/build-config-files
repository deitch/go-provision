It is possible to provide an initial DevicePortConfig and/or GlobalConfig
during the build.

The former can be used to specify proxies and static IP configuration for
the ports, if that is necessary to have the device connect to zedcloud.
But a DevicePortConfig can also be added to a USB stick in which case it
will be copied from the USB stick on boot. See mkusb.sh

The latter can be used to specify the initial timers and ssh/usb behavior
which will be in place until the device connects to zedcloud and gets its
configuration from there.

To add either during the build, in zenbuild's conf directory create a
subdirectory called DevicePortConfig or GlobalConfig, respectively.
Then add the valid json file named as global.json in that directory.

make conf.img; make installer.raw
